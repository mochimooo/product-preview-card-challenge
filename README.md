## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
```html
<link rel='stylesheet' type="text/css" href="sytle.css">
For this, I didn't include 'type' originally, and I thought just inputting 'css' instead of 'text/css' would work; it ended up stripping all the CSS codes. NEVER DO THAT AGAIN.
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

-I need to practice more on how to use CSS selectors more efficiently. For example: the font style for both "Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum" and "$149.99" is the same, and the only difference is the color. I don't know how to use combination CSS selector to ditinguish the two.


### Useful resources

- [CSS line-height Property](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_line-height.php) - I learned how to space out the description of the product by using line-height property.

- [How To-Cards](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp) - I still need to practice using this feature of CSS to make cards.
- [Deploying to GitHub Pages](https://www.codecademy.com/article/f1-u3-github-pages) - This website is helpful in explaining how to deploy more websites as you complete new challenge projects.
